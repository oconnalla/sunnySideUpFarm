        <p>Our story began with one mother's search for locally sourced food from well loved animals. We were sick of reading food labels longer than novels. We wanted to know the ingredients in our food.<br> Originally it was just two goats, a couple kids, and a lot of research. As our                           experience grew, so did our herd and so did our dreams! We realized we wanted to share our products with our community.</p>
