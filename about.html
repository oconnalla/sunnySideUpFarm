                <p>Our story began with one mother's search for locally sourced food from well cared for animals. We were sick of reading food labels longer than novels. We wanted to know what ingredients were in our food. <br> Originally it was just two goats, a couple kids, and a lot of research. As our experience grew, so did our herd and so did our dreams! We realized we wanted to share our products with our community.</p>

                <p>We're big on treating our community like family. <br>If we wouldn't eat it and we wouldn't use it, we won't sell it. </p>

                <p>Our farm is part of our family. We work hard to make sure our goats and chickens recieve the best care possible, and all the hugs they can handle! Our goats have free range through our fenced yard (as long as they aren't in heat), and our chickens are protected by a shelter built by our own caring hands. They receive quality food an vitamins, and daily care. It's a lot of work, but we believe happy animals make the best products.  </p>
